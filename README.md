# TidyTreeDrawings

Implementation of Wetherell and Shannon's paper for tidy tree drawings.
OpenGL (freeglut3) used for graphics routines.

Instructions
------------
1. Compile codes with gcc -lm -lglut -lGL -lGLU -lstdc++
2. Run generated executable for piano and play a few notes to generate
   tones and create a notes.txt buffer. 
3. Run executable for any algorithm to produce its visualization.

Note : 
You could play the piano and observe the changing visualization in realtime as well. Try running the visualizations of all three algorithms at the same time, and compare!
